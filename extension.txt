The judgment statement must end with ";".

<INSTRC> ::= <PRINT> | <SET> | <CREATE> | <LOOP> | <IFS>
<IFS> ::= "IF" <POLISHLIST> "{" <INSTRCLIST> <ELSELIST>
<ELSELIST> ::= <ELSEIF> <ELSELIST> | "ELSE" "{" <INSTRCLIST> ";" | ";"
<ELSEIF> ::= "ELSEIF" <POLISHLIST> "{" <INSTRCLIST>

(i.e. However, I've only finished the parser version for IF-ELSE.)
